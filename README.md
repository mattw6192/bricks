Brick defender

Bricks is a brick breaker / breakout clone developed by Dillon Wastrack and myself (Matt Williams) in Java. We created this game during our free time to test our programming skills. This game comes with many different powerups, and several different levels. High Scores are also kept up with, but only locally currently. The powerups are distributed on a psuedo random basis, and the types of powerups that are dropped change based on several different potential game states. This means that is certain things happen in the game, the probabilities of certain powerups increase/decrease accordingly. We have begun adding some sounds, and one or two graphics, however, these parts are still a work in progress.
